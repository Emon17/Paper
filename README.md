# Prediction of premature beats in the human hearts using machine learning techniques

Premature complexes are common electrocardiographic findings in daily clinical practice that require further evaluation. Their investigation may sometimes be complex and expensive. The aim of our study was to analyze variables associated with premature beats identified in outpatients referred from a primary care facility. Methods – We performed a cross-sectional study of 407 outpatients (aged 55.8±11years; 56% women) who were followed by general practitioners and were referred for resting 12-lead electrocardiograms for a routine clinical follow-up. After signing informed consent, patients answered a questionnaire and underwent physical examinations, laboratory diagnostics, transthoracic echocardiograms, and 24-hour Holter monitoring to evaluate for the presence of premature complexes. After the univariate analyses, logistic regression analyses were performed with adjustments for age, sex, and cardiovascular diseases. Results – Premature complexes distribution revealed that they were frequent but with low density. Premature atrial complexes (≥ 4/hours) were associated with age (Odds Ratio (OD)=1.030, Confidence Interval (CI) 95%=1.002 ─ 1.059, p=0.029), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels > 20mg/dL (OR=4.489, 95%CI=1.918 ─ 10.507, p=0.0005), intraventricular blocks (OR=4.184, 95%CI=1.816 ─ 9.406, p=0.0005) and left atrial diameter (OR=1.065, 95%CI=1.001 ─ 1.134, p=0.046). Premature ventricular complexes (≥ 5/hour) were related to age (OR=1.032, 95%CI=1.010 ─ 1.054, p=0.004), the use of calcium channel blockers (OR=2.248, 95%CI=1.019 ─ 4.954, p=0.045), HDL-cholesterol levels (OR=0.971, 95%CI=0.951 ─ 0.992, p=0.007), BNP levels > 20mg/dL (OR=2.079, 95%CI=0.991 ─ 0.998, p=0.033), heart rate (OR=1.019, 95%CI=1.001 ─ 1.038, p=0.041), left ventricular hypertrophy (OR=2.292, 95%CI=1.402 ─ 3.746, p=0.001) and left ventricular ejection fraction (OR=0.938, 95%CI=0.900 ─ 0.978, p=0.002). Conclusions – Premature complexes had low density and were associated with BNP levels > 20mg/dL, lower levels of HDL-cholesterol, left atrial enlargement, and ventricular hypertrophy. The identification of premature complexes on 24-hour Holter monitor recordings of outpatients in a primary public healthcare setting was associated with uncontrolled cardiovascular risk factors that may be addressed with medical advice and therapy in a primary care setting.
